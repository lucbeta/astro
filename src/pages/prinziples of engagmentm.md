> Text umarbeiten und schauen wie man es mit Astro veröffentlicht
1. Validate idea first.
2. Kill your EGO. Build for users and not want you thing is good.
3. Bootstrap.
4. Outsource nothing at all until PMF.
    - In a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It’s just yet another assignment in their boring job. Instead of coming up with great ideas for your project they will be just focusing on ramping up their skills to get a promotion or a better job offer.
5. Don’t hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year.
6. It may take a decade.
7. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.
	- Pick a simple template, edit texts with a no-code website builder in less than an hour and that's it!
	- At the early stage, You win traffic outside of your website, people are already interested, so don't make them search for the signup button among the texts! 
	- Focus on conversion optimization only when the traffic is consistent.
	- Keep it to one page.
8. Write Every Single day.
9. Post on Twitter daily.
    - I start posting on X. It’s the primary source of new connections and growth.
10. Do SEO from day 2.
    - As early as you can. It takes just 5 minutes to get it done on your landing page. Go to Google Keyword Planner, enter a few keywords around your product, sort them by traffic, filter out high competition kws, pick the top 10, and place them natively on your home page and meta tags.    
    - Add one blog article every week. Either manually or by paying for an AI blogging tool.
11. Chase global market from day 1.
    - If the product and marketing are good, it will work on the global market too, if it’s bad, it won’t work on the local market too. So better go global from day 1, so that if it works, the upside is 100x bigger. 
    - Launch to international markets from day 1. The size of the market is 10000x bigger. I can validate and grow products in days, not in years as it used to be.
12. Don’t build consumer apps. Only b2b.
    - Consumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It’s just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don’t.
    - Even if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge.
13. Use boilerplates.
    - I wasted years of dev time and millions of VC money to pay for basic things. To build yet another sidebar, yet another dashboard, and payment integration...
    - I had too much pride, I couldn't see myself taking someone else code as a basis for my product. I wanted it to be 100% mine, original, from scratch. Because my product seems special to me.

14. Being To Cheap. 
	- I always started by checking all competitors and setting the lowest price. I thought this would be one of the key advantages of my product. But no, I was wrong.
	- The audience on $5 and $50 are totally different.
	- $5: pain in the *ss, never happy, never recommend you to a friend, leave in 4 months.
	- $50: polite, give genuine feedback, happy, share with friends, become your big fan if you solve their request.
15. No Free Tier  
	- I'd launch a tool with a free tier, and it'd get sign-ups, but very few would convert. I'd treat free sign-ups as KPIs and run on it for years. I'd brag about signups and visitors. I'd even raise VC money with these stats. But eventually, I would fail to reach PMF. Because my main feedback would come from free users and the product turned into a perfect free product. 
	- Once I switched to "paid only" until I validated the product, things went really well. 
	- Free and paid users often need different products. Don't fall into this trap as I did.
16. Build Products For Audiences You Love.
	- I never thought of this. I'd often build products either for corporates, consumers, or for developers.
	- It turns out I have no love for all 3.
	- But I deeply love indie founders. Because they are risk-takers and partly kids in their hearts.
	- Once I switched the focus to indie makers on my products, my level of joy increased by 100x for me.
17. Spend more time with Family & Friends.
	- spending 10% of my time with family and friends would practically make no negative impact on my startups.
